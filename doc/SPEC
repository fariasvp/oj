== OJ Spec (0.1.0 Draft)
OJ is defined in terms of generators, modifiers, and query maps, each of which
is described below.

== Generators
OJ generators create partial SQL statements from a query map. They are
implemented as functions that process a query map and return a string.

== Modifiers
OJ modifiers manipulate and modify query maps. They are implemented as functions
that accept a query map, add or manipulate it in some way, and return a new
valid query map.

== Query Map
A query map is a Clojure map containing *at least* two of the following keys and
corresponding values:

  :table
    (Required, Keyword)
    The name of the table that the query acts upon.

---

  :select
    (Optional, Vector)
    The collection of column names to be selected from :table. If no :select
    is specified, the query will select all columns.

  :insert
    (Optional, IPersistentMap)
    A Clojure map of column names corresponding to desired values to insert into
    the :table.

  :update
    (Optional, IPersistentMap)
    A Clojure map of column names corresponding to desired values to update from
    a particular record in :table.

  :delete
    (Optional, Boolean)
    If true, signifies that you wish to delete a particular record from :table.

The presence of each of these four keys may also require the presence of the
following keys:

  :where
    (IPersistentMap)
    Required: (:update, :delete)
    Optional: (:select)
    A Clojure map containing column names and the corresponding values with which
    to filter results by.

  :order
    (Vector)
    Optional: (:select)
    A vector of two elements. The first is the column name to order by, the
    second is the direction with which to list the results (:desc or :asc).

  :limit
    (Integer)
    Optional: (:select)
    The number of results which to return from :table.
